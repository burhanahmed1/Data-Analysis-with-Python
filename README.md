## Introduction

This repository provides a structured approach to data acquisition, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and prediction model building. The analysis is performed on two datasets: AutoMobiles and Laptop Pricing. Each stage of the process is documented in Jupyter notebooks, offering a clear and reproducible workflow.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. **Data Acquisition and Basic Insights**: 
   - `AutoMobiles_data_acquisition.ipynb`
   - `Laptop_data_acquisition.ipynb`

2. **Data Wrangling**: 
   - `AutoMobiles_data_wrangling.ipynb`
   - `Laptop_data_wrangling.ipynb`

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - `AutoMobiles_EDA.ipynb`
   - `Laptop_EDA.ipynb`

4. **Prediction Models**:
   - `AutoMobiles_prediction_models.ipynb`
   - `Laptop_prediction_models.ipynb`

Each notebook in the folders is designed to handle the respective dataset, providing a step-by-step guide through the different phases of data science.
